wp-expand
=========

This simple WordPress plugin adds site support for collapsible content sections. Wrap sections in a div with class="expand", or highlight in the editor and click the  + icon. Note that, as currently implemented, the section must have a header, it must be the first item in the selection (immediately after the opening div tag), and it must be an h2 or h3 element.

This version relies on an icon from Font Awesome, which will be replaced in the future. In the mean time, if your theme does not have Font Awesome support, you can [grab a Font Awesome plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome/) to enable support.
